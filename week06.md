# Week 6 -- Ensemble methods (6 Oct 2020)

## Assignment (submit before class on 6 Oct 2020)

1. [lab_svm.ipynb](https://github.com/umbcdata602/fall2020/blob/master/lab_svm.ipynb) comes from Raschka's 
[ch03.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch03/ch03.ipynb),
and makes it easy to experiment with hyperparameters. Using it to:
    * Demonstrate and describe the most important effects of `C` on logistic regression and SVM.
    * Demonstrate and describe the most important effects of `gamma` on kernel SVM.
2. [lab_model_evaluation.ipynb](https://github.com/umbcdata602/fall2020/blob/master/lab_model_evaluation.ipynb)
comes from Raschka's [ch06.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch06/ch06.ipynb). In the analysis that gives rise to the ROC curve, 
Raschka does a couple things to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
    * Demonstrate and describe how the ROC curve changes when you add dimensionality back into the dataset.
