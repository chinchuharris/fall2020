# Projects

* These are projects designed to get you to research existing literature.
    * You should learn something new, practice what you learn and explain it in your own words.
    * Choose something of interest to you and strive to make it interesting for your classmates.
* New research
    * You can bring in a new dataset if you like, but it's not required.
    * If you take this approach, then you must use publicly available data.
* You can work independently or in groups of 2 or 3.
* DUE DATE: 15 Dec
    * Projects will be due as shared Colab notebooks on the date/time of the final exam.
    * Each student shall make an in-class presentations of 8-10 minutes during class time on that date.

## Requirements

* The project must be self contained in a Google Colab notebook linked to your UMBC account.
* Anyone with a UMBC account should be able to run the notebook in Colab without errors.
* Notebooks should run to completion in a couple minutes. If necessary, provide saved intermediate results.
* Notebooks should be heavily referenced and code should be well documented.
* Use text cells to describe visualizations, the purpose of code cells, and anything that you learned.

## Content

* Project ideas
    * Look at scikit-learn, tensorflow.org, introtodeeplearning.com, course texts or the literature.
    * You can investigate a new dataset with techniques that we covered in class.
    * You can explore of a new technique that we didn't cover in class.
    * Check with me to get feedback on your project ideas.
* Notebooks should describe (in your own words) what you learned along the way.
    * Include an introduction that describes your goals when choosing your project topic.
    * Describe any problems you encountered and the approach you took to solve them.
    * Describe your thought process as you worked to understand difficult/new concepts.
    * Provide short explanatory examples/demos that clarify more complex issues.
    * Include a discussion section that describes what you learned.
* It should be clear throughout your notebook where you got your code and data. 
    * Use only open data sources that are freely accessible on the Internet. Include links.
    * All code cells should be documented with inline comments.
    * Complex algorithms and code snipppets should be documented concisely within code cells.
    * Use text cells to provide overviews (1 or two sentences) for code cells and figures.
* The lab notebooks for [MIT 6.S191](www.introtodeeplearning.com) are exemplars.

## Recommendations

* Ask questions
    * I will be available to comment on drafts and questions.
    * Send me email with a link to your notebook.
    * Make your question/issue easy to find in your notebook.
* Start early, don't wait until the last minute.
    * I'll try to respond to questions quickly (less than 72 hours).
    * As the term rolls to an end, it may become harder for me to respond in a timely manner.
