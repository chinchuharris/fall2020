## Reading

* Rasckha & Mirjalili, Chapter 8

## Assignment (submit before class on 13 Oct 2020)

Raschka performs topic modeling on the IMDb dataset in cells 45-50 of ch08.ipynb.
In the related section of the text, he discusses three important hyperparameters.
Investigate the sensitivity to those hyperpameters in Colab.
Demonstrate and describe your results in a single notebook with sufficient detail
that they can be reproduced. Include in that notebook a paragraph summarizing
your major findings.

You're welcome to work in teams. 

If you work in teams and decide to make a single submission,
then identify all team members in the notebook and
have each team member submit a link to that notebook.

Be prepared to present your notebook and discuss your results during class.
