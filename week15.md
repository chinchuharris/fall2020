# Week 15 (8 Dec 2020)

Reinforcement Learning

### Projects

* The first half of class will be a quick quiz and reinforcement learning lab.
* In the last half of the class will be a quick review of projects, with Q/A as needed.
    * Be ready to provide a UMBC-shareable link to the latest draft the Colab notebook for your final project.
    * We'll check to be sure that I can to run your notebook to completion in a few minutes (or less).
    * There is no expectation that your project will be complete on 8 Dec 2020.
    * Rather, this is an opportunity for you to get feedback/guidance before final submission.
* Final projects are due December 15. 
* 8-minute project presentations will occur during class time (instead of a final exam) on 15 Dec
