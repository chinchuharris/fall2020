# Week 5 -- Model evaluation (29 Sep 2020)

## Assignment (due 29 Sep)

Submit the link(s) to your shared colab notebook(s) in Blackboard before class on 29 September.

1. Raschka and Geron both investigate a decision tree model with the Iris dataset. Explain why their results differ.
    * Rachka's [ch03.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch03/ch03.ipynb)
        * Look at the figure created by Cell 38 in Raschka's notebook
    * Geron's's [06_decision_trees.ipynb](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/06_decision_trees.ipynb)
        * Look at the figure created by Cell 9 in Geron's notebook
        * Note: You do not need a copy of Geron's text -- the example in Cell 9 is not discussed in his book.
2. Raschka uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset in Chapter 6.
    * Use PCA to create a plot of individual and cumulative explained variance for each eigenvector.
    * Create a scatterplot of the class distribution for the first two eigenvectors.
    * Contrast your results with Raschka analysis of the Wine dataset in Chapter 5.
    * Discuss the dimensionality of dataset.

We'll discuss solutions in class. Late submissions will be accepted, and they'll be marked late. For the best possible grade, a good strategy is to submit what's you've done before class then, if necessary, submit a corrected version after class.

## Reading

* Rasckha & Mirjalili, Chapter 6
