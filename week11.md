# Week 11 -- (10 Nov 2020)

## Assignment (Due 10 Nov 2020)

Make progress on your projects. 

Objective for the submission on 10 Nov: Link to a clean and concise Colab notebook that includes:

1. Concise description of the central hypothese(s)s that you'd like to test, or questions you'd like to answer, with your analysis.
2. One to three figures, with caption and accompanying code, that summarize the EDA of your dataset.

You are not expected to submit a completed notebook, or a working notebook with a lot of experimentation. 
Rather, you should submit a well documented summary statement and summary of your exploratory data analysis. 
You will surely have have more analysis to do, and your results may change. You don't need to include
any results at this stage, just simple, clear EDA.

## Reading and Study Guide

* Rasckha & Mirjalili, Chapter 13 & parts of 14
    * Skim the reading in Chapter 14 on Tensorflow 1
    * And skim the final section in Chapter 14 on Tensorflow Estimators
* Familiarize yourself with [ch13_part1.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch13/ch13_part1.ipynb).
* Familiarize yourself with [ch13_part2.ipynb](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/blob/master/ch13/ch13_part2.ipynb).
    * Some questions on the quiz will refer to these two notebooks.
* There are 3 noteboooks associated with Chapter 14
    * We'll work with these in class but no quiz questions will involve Chapter 14 notebooks.
